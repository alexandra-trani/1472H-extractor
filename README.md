# 1472H-extractor
Extract text from 1472H with ease! 

As it stands, the extractor file pulls all the section headers, sections, and numeric identification from Chapter 5 of 1472H.
Tables and figures are all identified as 5.999.

## Future Work
I am in the process of converting this into a quick python function for easy calling at a later date.
